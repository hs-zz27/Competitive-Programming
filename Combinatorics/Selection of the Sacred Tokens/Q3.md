# 3. Selection of the Sacred Tokens

### Description
You are given n tokens, where the i-th token has a value a[i].

You want to select some tokens such that:

 - The number of selected tokens is even.
 - The sum of selected values is divisible by m.

Count the number of valid subsets.

The empty set is not counted because it has size 0, which is even, but its sum (0) is divisible by m — however, the problem requires selecting at least 2 tokens.

### Input
- The first line contains integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000).
- The second line contains n integers a[i] (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10⁹).

### Output
Print the number of valid selections.

### Sample

**Output:**
