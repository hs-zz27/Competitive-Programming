# 1. The Lost Temple Paths

### Description
An explorer is inside a temple represented as a grid of R × C rooms.
He starts at (1, 1) and wants to reach (R, C).
He can only move right or down.

However, some rooms contain ancient traps.
For each row i, you are given exactly one trap in column ti.

The explorer must avoid all trap rooms.

Compute the number of distinct safe paths from start to finish.

### Input
- First line: integers R, C
- Second line: array t of size R, where t[i] is the trap column in row i (1-indexed)

### Output
Number of safe paths modulo 1e9+7.
